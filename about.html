My name is Danyal Zia, I live in Karachi, Pakistan — a fast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Karachi" target="_blank">developing city</a>. I’m graduating at University of Karachi, where I’m studying software engineering as a major. I like to program applications to make my life easier. I enjoy learning different programming languages. My main interest is in native compiled programming languages; I prefer static/strongly typed languages such as C/C++, C#, Java, D, etc. In the recent months, I have contributed to some open-source projects that are hosted on Github; I occasionally&nbsp;host my projects and code snippets there too!<br />
<br />
I currently do freelance software development and content writing for different sites - mostly for the clients outside Pakistan. I love to read books, particularly in the genre of philosophy, spirituality/religion, YA (Young Adult) and self-help. Apart from programming and writing skills, I like to play musical instruments (acoustic guitar, etc.). I love listening to rock (alternative, gothic, etc.) and western classical music (Beethoven, etc.) I regularly do covers of contemporary rock songs as hobby, and practice arranging the classical music in my acoustic guitar. Even though my singing isn’t as good as playing the instruments, I do have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor" target="_blank">Tenor</a> voice, and so I can sing western songs quite comfortably.<br />
<br />
I’m an introvert and belongs to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INFJ" target="_blank">INFJ</a> personality type; only one percent of the population has an <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/INFJ.html" target="_blank">INFJ personality type</a>, so in that way, I’m very rare and unique. In a nutshell: I write better than I speak, I think before I speak, I’m sensitive and kind, I can’t speak louder, and I love to spend most of time alone reading books and playing/listening music.<br />
<br />
When I began working as a freelancer, I had an ambition&nbsp;to make my&nbsp;personal site — a site which&nbsp;can&nbsp;be a one-stop shop for my contact information. Apart from my general contact info and services, I have a <a href="http://blog.danyalzia.com/">blog</a> (hosted on Tumblr) which hosts blog posts and articles on programming, computer tips/tricks, writing, book reviews, music, philosophy, introversion and other personality traits, motivational quotes/images — and sometimes politics too (<span class="correction  alternate" id="GingerWidget-correction-0">occasionally</span>, don’t get scared!); basically anything that makes me happy!<br />
<br />
You can reach me on social media networks (links are given in the sidebar).<br />
