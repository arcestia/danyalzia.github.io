I am a freelance software developer, an occasional writer and an entrepreneur. I am the guy behind this site and the author of its blog posts. I live in Karachi, Pakistan — a fast [developing city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Karachi). I’m graduating at University of Karachi, where I’m studying software engineering as a major. I like to program applications to make my life easier. I enjoy learning different programming languages. My main interest is in native compiled programming languages; I prefer static / strongly typed languages such as C/C++, C#, Java, D, etc. In the recent months, I have contributed to some open-source projects that are hosted on Github; I occasionally host my projects and code snippets there too!

I currently do freelance software development and content writing for different sites - mostly for the clients outside Pakistan. I love to read books, particularly in the genre of philosophy, spirituality/religion, YA (Young Adult) and self-help. Apart from programming and writing skills, I like to play musical instruments (acoustic guitar, etc.). I love listening to rock (alternative, gothic, etc.) and western classical music (Beethoven, etc.) I regularly do covers of contemporary rock songs as hobby, and practice arranging the classical music in my acoustic guitar. Even though my singing isn’t as good as playing the instruments, I do have a [Tenor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor) voice, and so I can sing western songs quite comfortably.

I’m an introvert and belongs to [INFJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INFJ) personality type; only one percent of the population has an [INFJ personality type](http://www.personalitypage.com/INFJ.html), so in that way, I’m very rare and unique. In a nutshell: I write better than I speak, I think before I speak, I’m highly sensitive and an empath, I can’t speak louder, and I love to spend most of time alone reading books and playing / listening music.

When I began working as a freelancer, I had an ambition to make my personal site — a site which can be a one-stop shop for my contact information. Apart from my general contact info and services, this site hosts blog posts, articles and my opinions on programming, writing, book reviews, music, philosophy, introversion and other personality traits, motivational quotes / images — and sometimes politics too (occasionally, don’t get scared!); basically anything that makes me happy!

You can reach me on social media networks (links are given in the sidebar).
