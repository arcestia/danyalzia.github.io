I am a freelance software developer, writer and an entrepreneur. I am the guy behind this site and the author of its blog posts. I live in Karachi, Pakistan — a fast [developing city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Karachi). I’m studying software engineering as a major from University of Karachi, but I always enjoy learning different things. I currently do freelance software development and content writing for different websites - mostly for the clients outside Pakistan; I enjoy working remotely!

I’m an [INFJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INFJ). About one percent of the population has an [INFJ personality type](http://www.personalitypage.com/INFJ.html) (check yours from [here](http://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test
)), so in that way, I’m very rare and unique (both strength and weakness). In a nutshell: I write better than I speak, I think before I speak, I’m highly sensitive and empath, I can’t speak louder, and I love to spend most of time alone reading books, playing / listening music and living in my idealist dreams.

I have a natural tendency for creative writing, so my writing style is undisciplined and inspiration-driven. I enjoy practicing my creative writing through this blog. I love to read books, particularly in the genre of philosophy, spirituality / religion, YA (Young Adult) and self-help.

Apart from programming and writing skills, I like to play musical instruments (acoustic guitar, etc.). I love listening to rock (alternative, gothic, etc.) and western classical music (Beethoven, etc.) I regularly do covers of contemporary rock songs as hobby, and practice arranging the classical music in my acoustic guitar. Even though my singing isn’t as good as playing the instruments, I do have a [Tenor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor) voice, and so I can sing western songs quite comfortably.

When I began working as a freelancer, I had an ambition to make my personal site — a site which can be a one-stop shop for my contact information. Apart from my general contact info and services, this site hosts blog posts, articles and my opinions on programming, creative writing, book reviews, music, philosophy, introversion and other personality traits — and sometimes politics too (occasionally, don’t get scared!); basically anything that makes me happy!

You can reach me on social media networks (links are given in the sidebar).

PS: Feel free to poke around the site and [contact me]({{baseurl}}/contact) if needed!
