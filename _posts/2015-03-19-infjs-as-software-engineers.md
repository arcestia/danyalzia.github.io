<span class="firstcharacter">M</span>any INFJs wonder whether software engineering is a good career choice for them. They may be forced into this career by their parents, or they may feel compelled to do a major in this field of engineering, considering the growing demand of programmers.

The common belief is that INFJs are better off choosing such careers where their [extroverted feelings (Fe)](http://personalitygrowth.com/extraverted-feeling-fe/) can be utilized. Careers such as counseling, therapy, teaching, writing, etc. can be found in the *dream careers* list on websites providing career suggestions based on a person's [MBTI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator).

Often times, software engineering is listed in suitable careers for [xNTx types](http://www.quora.com/Do-most-software-engineers-have-an-INTP-personality-type), citing that Rationality / Thinking ([Ti](http://personalitygrowth.com/introverted-thinking/) or [Te](http://personalitygrowth.com/extraverted-thinking/)) is required for the logical step-by-step arrangement of the programs. Many INFJs would say that they don't find fulfillment in the field, because they can't use their empathy to help others or make the world a better place. INFJs are warm, polite and friendly to others and they are interested in sharing their feelings, but most software development environments are cold and doesn't encourage meaningful *deep* conversations among employees.

As an INFJ, I would say I love software engineering. This is the blog post to encourage INFJs who are already in software engineering to pursue their dreams within the field. I will highlight the points that I love in software engineering, and how I can utilize my soul in it without leaving this field.

### 1) Learning new things in every stage

Software engineering is a field where you are supposed to learn new things at every stage of your software development because:

* Frameworks and libraries that are used in building big software change just in a period of few months and years.
* New programming languages emerges which replaces old languages.
* Software design patterns are changed with the environment.

People with highly developed [introverted intuition (Ni)](http://personalitygrowth.com/introverted-intuition/) find it appealing to learn about new things. I always tend to enjoy learning different programming languages and frameworks. I learn things through abstraction, rather than reading about concrete details. Theories, ideas and possibilities come naturally to me.

### 2) Problem solving through introverted intuition (Ni)

The thing I love most in software engineering is that I can use my highly developed [introverted intuition (Ni)](http://personalitygrowth.com/introverted-intuition/) to solve the problems. I can understand the problem without even consciously thinking about it!

### 3) Opportunity to develop my introverted thinking (Ti)

Through the successful development of softwares, I can develop my tertiary function of [introverted thinking (Ti)](http://personalitygrowth.com/introverted-thinking/) due to the experience I can gain through logical arrangement of programs. Studies show that the tertiary jungian function develops [after the age of 20](http://www.personalitypage.com/development.html). This is a perfect age for me.

### 4) Innovations for the good of human beings

As INFJs always look for opportunities to help others, I found it very rewarding to work on projects which can help people in shaping their lives or educating them. I can only be happy as a software engineer if my projects are affecting the people positively. Because of this reason, I tend to enjoy developing and contributing to open-source projects rather than building a software for a company.

## Conclusion

I have tried to make a point that just because you have empathy doesn't mean you are ought to choose a career where all you can do is to sit alone or sympathize with others for the money. For me, it's more rewarding to help people in the cold environment -- because that's where many people need the actual help, and you don't get paid for that humanitarian work!

**Question: If you are an INFJ software developer, which is the thing that you like the most in your field?**
