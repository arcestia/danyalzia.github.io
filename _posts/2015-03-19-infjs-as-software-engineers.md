<span class="firstcharacter">M</span>any INFJs wonder whether software engineering is a good career choice for them. They may be forced into this career by their parents, or they may feel compelled to do a major in this field of engineering, considering the growing demand of programmers.

The common belief is that INFJs are better off choosing such careers where their [extroverted feelings (Fe)](http://personalitygrowth.com/extraverted-feeling-fe/) can be utilized. Careers such as counseling, therapy, teaching, writing, etc. can be found in the *dream careers* list on websites providing career suggestions based on a person's [MBTI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator).

Often times, software engineering is listed in suitable careers for [xNTx types](http://www.quora.com/Do-most-software-engineers-have-an-INTP-personality-type), citing that Rationality / Thinking ([Ti](http://personalitygrowth.com/introverted-thinking/) or [Te](http://personalitygrowth.com/extraverted-thinking/)) is required for the logical step-by-step arrangement of the programs. Many INFJs would say that they don't find fulfillment in the field, because they can't use their empathy to help others or make the world a better place. INFJs are generally warm, polite and friendly to the others and they are interested in helping people and even share their feelings. They seek meanings in any work, but most software development environments are cold and doesn't encourage meaningful *deep* conversations among employees.

As an INFJ, I would say I really like software engineering. This is the blog post to encourage INFJs who are already in software engineering to pursue their dreams within the field. I will highlight the points that I love in software engineering, and how I can utilize my soul in it without leaving this field.

### 1) Learning new things in every stage

Software engineering is a field where you are supposed to learn new things at every stage of your software development because:

* Frameworks and libraries that are used in building big software change just in a period of few months and years.
* New programming languages emerges which replaces old languages.
* Software design patterns are changed with the environment.

People with highly developed [introverted intuition (Ni)](http://personalitygrowth.com/introverted-intuition/) find it appealing to learn about new things. I always tend to enjoy learning different programming languages and frameworks. I learn things through abstraction, rather than reading about concrete details. Theories, ideas and possibilities come naturally to me.

### 2) Problem solving through introverted intuition (Ni)

The thing I love most in software engineering is that I can use my highly developed [introverted intuition (Ni)](http://personalitygrowth.com/introverted-intuition/) to get to the "big picture" of a complex problem. I can understand the problem even without consciously thinking about it which amazes people!

When a problem arises, I go to its core, research about it on the internet (if it's possible) and connect the dots to understand exactly where the problem lies.

### 3) Opportunity to develop my introverted thinking (Ti)

Through the successful development of softwares, I can develop my tertiary function of [introverted thinking (Ti)](http://personalitygrowth.com/introverted-thinking/) due to the experience I can gain through logical arrangement of programs. Studies show that the tertiary jungian function develops [after the age of 20](http://www.personalitypage.com/development.html). This is a perfect age for the typical INFJ (with high Fe) to develop their Ti.

In my case, I have highly developed Ti and less developed Fe at this stage. It's common for male INFJs to mistype themselves as INTP or INTJ because of their unusually developed Ti, because most of them suppress their Fe in favor of Ti. They are most likely at advantage in software development.

### 4) Innovations for the good of human beings

As INFJs always look for opportunities to help others, I found it very rewarding to work on projects which can help people in shaping their lives or educating them. I can only be happy as a software engineer if my projects are affecting the people positively. Because of this reason, I tend to enjoy developing and contributing to [open-source projects](https://github.com/danyalzia) rather than building a software for a company.

Conversely, I won't be motivated to work on a project if there is no real cause behind it. I must always do something *meaningful*.

### 5) A great number of sub-fields

There are many sub-fields within software engineering, including a sub-field called [Educational software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_software) where programmers are supposed to develop softwares for the educational purpose to be used by HUMANS for their personal growth. There is an educational consultant side as well where you can use your Fe to teach people with your knowledge, thus helping people unleashing their potential.

## Conclusion

Although, it's unlikely that I'll be doing programming all my life, but nevertheless it's a stair towards my goals. I have tried to make a point that just because you have empathy doesn't mean you are ought to choose a career where all you can do is to sit alone or sympathize with others for the money. For me, it's more rewarding to help people in the cold environment -- because that's where many people need the actual help, and you don't get paid for that humanitarian work!

**Question: If you are an INFJ software developer, which is the thing that you like the most in your field?**
