<span class="firstcharacter">O</span>ften we found ourselves in the grip of existential depression, where the life stops making sense. At such moments, spending time with like-minded people improves the emotional health and may help you in finding the good in life. However, at times, you don't find anyone around you. I found the following quotes incredibly fascinating which give the profound meaning to your life:

### 1) "Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death. If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present. Our life has no end in the way in which our visual field has no limits." - Ludwig Wittgenstein

Reading this poetic utter of Ludwig, you might not be able to grasp the meaning at first, as he didn't mention the perspective through which he sees the life. In this quote, he meant that we can't experience "death" because our consciousness stops when are dead. We can only experience "dying". If you are living to experience a death, then you are not living at all. There is no death for us. We all are eternal.

### 2) "And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music." - Friedrich Nietzsche

This is a remarkable quotation of Friedrich. He argued that people only see things from their perspectives, which is shaped by their experiences, genetics and environmental factors. When the same people find someone "out of the box", they laugh at him, bully him, or even hurt him verbally and physically in order to "fix" him, because they think they care for him, believing the person does things because of his insanity, without realizing the inherent meaning or motivation or possibilities.

### 3) "A perfection of means and a confusion of aims, seems to be our main problem." - Albert Einstein

Many World problems can be solved. We have the potential to fix our problems right away; we are good at getting things done, but are extremely bad at deciding what should be done

### 4) "All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident." - Arthur Schopenhauer

People don't actually accept the truth. They end up calling it "self-evident" when they can't go anywhere to defend themselves.

### 5) "Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man." - Friedrich Nietzsche

Friedrich beautifully translated "Ignorance is a bliss" into the human language. The desire for truth, the curiosity of things leads to the destruction of one's health.
