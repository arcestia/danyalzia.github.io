![Coding Makes You Happy!]({{ baseurl }}/media/images/CMYH.jpg)

<span class="firstcharacter">A</span>nother intuitive. This time I have created a [separate blog for programming](http://codingmakesyouhappy.com). The reason for this is that I want this site / blog to be my personal / professional home page only, and I don't want to fill it with programming tutorials. The tutorials that were hosted on this blog were migrated there. From now on, this blog is about my opinions on programming, software development and personal development, so all the future programming tutorials will reside in the aforementioned site.
