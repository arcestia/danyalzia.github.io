![Coding Makes You Happy!]({{ baseurl }}/media/images/CMYH.jpg)

<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>oday I made another intuitive. This time I have created a [separate blog for programming](http://codingmakesyouhappy.com), where I will be posting the tutorials on different programming languages, such as, C, C++, Java, etc. and basic concepts of programming, such as, variables, functions, OOP, etc. The purpose of this website is to make you happy when you do coding!

The reason for the separation is that I want this site / blog to be my personal / professional home page only, and I don't want to fill it with programming tutorials. The tutorials that were hosted on this blog were migrated there. From now on, this blog is about my opinions on programming, software development and personal development, so all the future programming tutorials will reside in the aforementioned site.
