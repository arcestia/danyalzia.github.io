title: Created a separate blog for programming tutorials
---

Another intuitive. This time I have created a [separate blog for programming](http://codingmakesyouhappy.com). The reason for this is that I want this site/blog to be my personal/professional home page only, and I don't want to fill it with programming tutorials. The tutorials that are hosted on this blog will be migrated to the aforementioned blog.
