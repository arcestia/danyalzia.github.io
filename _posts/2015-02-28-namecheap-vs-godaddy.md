<b>This is my honest piece of review on the services of <a href="http://blog.danyalzia.com/namecheap">Namecheap</a> and <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>. I only recommend product I personally use.</b><br />
<br />
When I created my <a href="https://www.blogger.com/danyalzia.com">blog</a> on Tumblr, I badly wanted to buy the custom domain for it. I didn't want to buy the hosting, as Tumblr already provided the platform for me to blog regularly and create pages for my services. Also, Tubmlr provides almost complete control / customization (HTML/CSS, etc.), so there was no reason for me to buy the hosting for other blogging platforms (self-hosted WordPress, etc.) because I didn't want that extra functionality of those, such as plugins (i.e., PHP support), etc.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I did google "<b>Cheap domains</b>" and found GoDaddy on top of the search page, so I thought that they were the most popular domain registrar in the world. I went through the site and completed the signup there, hoping to buy the domain. They register country specific <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain">TLD (Top-Level Domain)</a> as well (<b>.pk</b> in my case), and they were showing the prices in <b>PKR</b>... which seemed good to me, because it had given me the impression that Pakistani entrepreneurs / freelancers prefer to buy domain from them. They were charging around <b>$14.99 / year </b>for <b>.com</b> domain, however, they were forcing me to buy the hosting from them as well, so for me their ordering step wasn't very user-friendly at all.<br />
<br />
I then found another domain registrar, namely, <a href="http://blog.danyalzia.com/namecheap">Namecheap</a> from the Wikipedia page of <a href="https://www.blogger.com/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Daddy">GoDaddy</a> while reading the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">internet freedom controversy</a>. I visited the page and fell in love with its simplicity. They were giving <b>.com</b> domain for <b>$10.69 / year</b> with a free <a href="https://www.blogger.com/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whois">WHOIS</a> guard for the first year, so they were indeed cheaper than GoDaddy.<br />
<br />
I don't have any experience in buying the hosting from either of them, but for getting a custom domain for your Tumblr/Blogger/WordPress blog, I would highly recommend <a href="http://blog.danyalzia.com/namecheap">Namcheap</a> because of their user-friendly website and (a bit) cheaper domain registration.<br />
