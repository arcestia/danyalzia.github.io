Depression comes in various forms: Minor, Major, Chronic, etc. About [9% of the U.S. population](http://www.webmd.com/depression/news/20100930/how-many-in-united-states-are-depressed) is affected by depression, from which 3.4% suffer from Major Depression. Whatever form of depression you experience, you may find difficulty in coping with it.

Writing down feelings is a form of verbalization. Studies show that [verbalizing our feeling](http://mybrainfacts.com/cont01/084.html) lessens the sadness, anger and pain, especially in people who find it hard to express their emotions to others in spoken words. Most people don't get that when I am writing my feelings down, whether in a private journal or in social media networks, I am actually releasing my pain. It's a form of therapy for me.

Although, I struggle many times in putting my exact feelings down as I run into anxiety while being obsessed with my deep thoughts and can't focus clearly on a single thought at a time, as I tend to think in the [abstraction and images](laurensapala.com/?p=897
), I nevertheless feel that it's the best way for me to release the pain, especially due to the fact that my creativity works tremendously when I am feeling something. I always feel like I'm good at expressing myself when I put my thoughts into writing as eloquently as possible; it comes naturally to me!

If you struggle with stress, depression, or anxiety, then keeping a journal can help you gain control of your emotions and it may improve your mental health. Following are the good outcomes that I have experienced while writing down my feelings:

### 1) Insight on Emotional Distress

It feels good to get all of those thoughts and emotions out of my head down on the paper/screen. The world seems clearer after it. Writing while I am emotionally distressed increases my insight on myself when I am happy... about the things which went wrong and caused the actual distress.

When I have a problem and I am stressed, I write my thoughts/feelings in a journal to identify what exactly is causing the stress or anxiety. Then, once Iâ€™ve identified what causes it, I can work on a plan to resolve the problems and thus reduce the stress.

### 2) Ease in putting feelings into words

It's a lot easier for me to put my feelings into words rather than to talk about it openly in public. Many people (mostly extroverts) find it a lot easier to express their thoughts and feelings through spoken words to anyone in public, while some of us (introverts) only share their thoughts and feelings with limited people they trust.

Writing down my inner feelings gives me the opportunity to understand myself more the way I am without having a fear of the judgement of others.

### 3) The consequences can be controlled

Through writing, I can have full control of the actions of my feelings; the decision will less likely be affected by my emotions if I write it down the moment I feel them. If I don't have the opportunity to write, and no trustworthy friend to hear me, then I have potential to do such things which I can regret later.

Taking decisions out of emotions is very common in feelers -- people with developed [extraverted feeling (Fe)](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/Extraverted-Feeling.cfm). Thinkers and rationalists are better in coping with it because their decisions are more often based on a [rationale and logic](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/Introverted-Thinking.cfm).

### 4) Less likely to self-harm

People with depression are prone to do self-harm and they tend to have intense suicidal thoughts at many times. About [4% of the adults](http://www.onlinesociologydegree.net/resources/the-sociology-of-self-injury/) in U.S. indulge in self harm. If I am successful in putting my exact feelings on a paper/screen, then there is a great chance that I will less likely indulge in self-harm activities.

Our brain gets calmed when we discuss about our emotions, but when we don't have anyone to hear us, then it's better to write it down to be read later. Writing your feelings in a journal is a *better* option than to take harmful actions based on your mood.

## Final Thoughts

If you have been reading my blog posts, then you may have noticed that I put my subjective values in many places. Many of my writing pieces come from my journal where I put my emotions while my creativity is at work. Doing so not only helps me giving more insight on myself in my mood, but it also greatly helps in building the trust of my readers as they would know who I am really.

Writing down your feelings isn't a replacement of proper therapy, but it's a great way to reduce your depression if you know how to write.
