I have migrated the programming posts / guides that were hosted on this blog to my sister-site: [Coding Makes You Happy!](http://codingmakesyouhappy.com). From now on, this blog is about my opinions on programming, software development and personal development, so all the future programming tutorials will reside in the aforementioned site.
