<span class="firstcharacter">N</span>euroticism is the constant feeling of worry, self-consciousness and perfectionism. Neurotic people are moody, irritable and very anxious. In the society, highly neurotic people have been considered less likely to succeed than the healthy ones because of their attitude to take anxiety at every difficult stage in their life.  The [American Psychologist article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2792076/) says, "Indeed, it predicts shorter, less happy, less healthy, and less successful lives to a meaningful extent,". Neuroticism can increase the risk of mental conditions and physical health problems. However, recent studies show that high neuroticism can actually lead to success and good health if the person is driven by high conscientious.

According to a [University of Rochester Medical Center study](www.urmc.rochester.edu), some self-described neurotics also tended to have the lowest levels of Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a biomarker for inflammation and chronic disease. Those neurotics are apparently the ones with high levels of conscientious.

Conscientious people tend to be organized, good planners, follow a routine, do the job thoroughly, and are strong-willed. Both Neuroticism and Conscientious are considered the part of [Big Five](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) personality traits, along with extraversion, agreeableness and openness to experience. People with the combination of these traits are considered *healthy neurotic*.

If a person is highly neurotic, but lacks conscientious, then his worry and anxiety will leave him nowhere and he will do excessive drinking and smoking to cope with it, thus creating the vicious circle. But, if the person has a high degree of conscientious, then his anxiety will provide him the motivation and drive to achieve things. He can do anything he set his mind to. He has the following characteristics that set them apart from other neurotics:

### Higher Self Awareness

These individuals are highly aware of themselves. They know exactly about their flaws and weakness, and they are not afraid to admit their mistakes, although they greatly fear to make mistakes in the first place. They can be self-denying. Their self-awareness AND the will to do the right thing can make them great achievers.

### Higher drive and will power

Many people lack drive to achieve their goals. Conscientious people set their goals efficiently to finish their plans. The anxiety and perfectionism arise from neuroticism forces them to achieve those goals. However, overdriven people can end up burning them out.

### Misery leads to better plans

Conscientious people are planners. They do not leave any room for the improvement. When the anxiety makes them depressed, then they make a few changes in plan to see what exactly caused the anxiety. Any misery in their life will result in the improvement of their plans, and they aren't afraid to back down while distressed for their own health.

### Tendency to finish the job

These individuals are usually high achievers because they always feel that there is something that needs to be done. They can't get rest unless their job is in the progress. Their perfectionism leads them to do extraordinary things that others can only imagine. They are always willing to improve the existing things.

### Artistic bend

As neurotics are highly self-aware, they can have great inner artistic qualities. They are good at self-expression and they have plenty of ideas in their heads. When these qualities combined with the power of conscientiousness then the person ends up creating the outstanding art. They don't only think, but act on it as well because they fear that their anxiety will kick in if they don't translate their ideas into reality.

## Improving the Conscientiousness

It is very possible to increase the conscientiousness in yourself. It seems that less organized people tend to become more organized as they get older and mature. They may also be forced by their peers to become more organized and responsible. You can do a few things to increase your conscientiousness:

* Acknowledge your lack of responsibility 
* Start planning your schedules
* Stick to the plan
* Force yourself to meet the deadlines
* Never give up

## Final Thoughts

If you can relate to the traits provided in this post, then you are an *healthy neurotic*. If that's the case: You shouldn't let anyone tell you that you aren't beautiful just because the society consider you "different". You can have a good amount of conscientious in you that will force you to do things the right way and "fix" the problems within yourself.
