<span class="firstcharacter">M</span>any of us suffer from anxiety at some stage of our life. Whether you may be anxious about giving the public speech, or maybe you are anxious about dealing with your boss. If you are frequently experiencing anxiety and you find yourself struggling to cope with it on a regular basis, then perhaps your anxiety is caused by the underlying mental illness.

Around [40 million](http://www.adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics) people in the U.S. are affected by Anxiety disorders. It is considered the most common mental illness. Although, anxiety disorders are highly treatable, yet only about one-third of those suffering from it receive treatment. Most people don't have the capability to *not* afraid of the responsibility it bears on them once they know about themselves and their problems.

Anxiety disorder is usually genetic, however, it can also caused by life-events, personality and environment. Parents may be afraid to diagnose their children, fearing the responsibility they would get once they know the truth, thus a child gets a victim of [child neglect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_neglect). A person being anxious about some event for a while isn't affected by anxiety disorder. For whatever reasons you feel anxious, there are ways to cope with it. Following are some of the ways I use to cope with my generalized anxiety:

### 1) Acknowledge your anxiety

Most people run away from their anxiety wrongfully believing that it's the way to cope with it, but the truth is: It only worsens the anxiety! Think about it: You feel anxious while socialising (considering you have the symptoms of social phobia), so you retreat yourself from the social event, even the small ones, because that's the easiest way for you to escape that feeling of worthlessness. Now, the vicious cycle of shame and fear will become stronger than ever.

When you feel anxiety, or you get a panic attack, then acknowledge it by completely submitting  yourself in the present moment. Once you acknowledge that it's the feeling that you've experienced before, then it would become much easier to find out what exactly caused the anxiety.

### 2) Analyze your thought patterns

Break your thought pattern into pieces and analyze them step-by-step. Try understanding what makes you anxious. Re-evaluate your thoughts and compare them to your past behaviors. If you can't analyze at any moment, then go outside and do something so you don't get yourself in an endless loop of over-thinking.

Labeling the thoughts and feelings also help in analyzing them accurately. Study about the different terms which define different feelings through the internet and try applying those terms to your own thoughts/feelings.

### 3) Ask your friends for the help

Good empathic-listening friends can be a great gift. You can use the emotional connection between you and your friends to reduce the sensation of shame and fear. Ask your friends for the help to tell you what is causing the anxiety. If they really care for you, then they would provide you emotional support. You cannot analyze everything about yourself on your own.

Make sure you ask help from the right person, as some people are bullies who just want to make the lives of others miserable.

### 4) Write your feelings down

When no one is around you, the best way to understand your thought process is to write it down in a private journal. Write exactly what you are feeling at the moment. Once you are not feeling anxious, then read your writing to understand them better.

Writing down feelings also [help with depression](http://danyalzia.com/2015/03/22/how-writing-down-my-feelings-helps-with-depression/). It's not uncommon for someone with an anxiety disorder to also suffer from depression or vice versa. Nearly one-half of those diagnosed with depression are also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.

## Final Thoughts

It's a lot better to accept your anxiety than to run away from it. You would be stronger once you realize that there are other people like you who know exactly what it feels like to have some sort of anxiety disorder. Some people are willing to help you in overcoming your problems, you just need to find the right people.
