<span class="firstcharacter">D</span>epression comes in various forms: Minor, Major, Chronic, etc. About [9% of the U.S. population](http://www.webmd.com/depression/news/20100930/how-many-in-united-states-are-depressed) is affected by depression, from which 3.4% suffer from Major Depression. Whatever form of depression you experience, you may find difficulty in coping with it.

Writing down feelings is a form of verbalization. Studies show that [verbalizing our feeling](http://mybrainfacts.com/cont01/084.html) lessens the sadness, anger and pain, especially in people who find it hard to express their emotions to others in spoken words. Most people don't get that when they are writing their feelings down, whether in a private journal or in social media networks, they are actually releasing their pain. It's a form of therapy.

Although, people can struggle many times in putting their exact feelings down as they can run into anxiety while being obsessed with their deepest thoughts and can't focus clearly on a single thought at a time, as it could be possible that they tend to think in the abstraction and images, they nevertheless sometimes feel that it's the best way for them to release the pain, especially due to the fact that many express their creativity in the form of writing.

If you struggle with stress, depression, or anxiety, then keeping a journal can help you gain control of your emotions and it may improve your mental health. Following are the good outcomes that people may experience while writing down their feelings:

### 1) Insight on Emotional Distress

It feels good to get all of those thoughts and emotions out of the head down on the paper / screen. The world seems clearer after it. Writing while emotionally distressed increases the insight about yourself when you are happy about the things which went wrong and caused the actual distress.

When you have a problem and you are stressed, try writing your thoughts / feelings in a journal to identify what exactly is causing the stress or anxiety. Then, once you've identified what caused it, you can work on a plan to resolve the problems, thus reducing the stress.

### 2) Ease in putting feelings into words

It's a lot easier for many people to put their feelings into words rather than to talk about it openly in public. Many people (mostly extroverts) find it a lot easier to express their thoughts and feelings through spoken words to anyone in public, while some of us (introverts) only share their thoughts and feelings with limited people they trust.

Writing down the inner feelings gives your the opportunity to understand yourself without having a fear of the judgement of others.

### 3) The consequences can be controlled

Through writing, you can have full control of the actions of your feelings; the decision will less likely be affected by your emotions if you write it down the moment you feel them. If you don't have the opportunity to write, and no trustworthy friend to hear you, then you have the potential to do such things which you can regret later.

### 4) Less likely to self-harm

People with depression are prone to do self-harm and they tend to have intense suicidal thoughts at many times. About [4% of the adults](http://www.onlinesociologydegree.net/resources/the-sociology-of-self-injury/) in U.S. indulge in self harm. If you are successful in putting your exact feelings on a paper / screen, then there is a great chance that you will less likely indulge in self-harm activities.

Our brain gets calmed when we discuss about our emotions, but when we don't have anyone to hear us, then it's better to write it down to be read later. Writing your feelings in a journal is a *better* option than to take the harmful actions based on your current mood.

## Final Thoughts

Writing down your feelings isn't a replacement of proper therapy, but it's a great way to reduce your depression if you know how to write.
