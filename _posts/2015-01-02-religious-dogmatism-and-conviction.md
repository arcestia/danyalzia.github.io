<span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n this 21st century, the world has become a global village where people are connected with each other through the internet. People have become civilized, intellectually independent and started questioning their faith; it has now become hard to force your beliefs on others and expect them to give respect to you!

Humans have evolved intellectually and realized that organized religions and ideologies only killed more people and deterred progression. If you think that girls shouldn’t be in schools or women without veil don’t deserve respect or people deserves to die for merely holding a different belief and writing a book criticizing your faith, then you have so much in common with the Taliban, ISIS, etc.

Humans deserve respect, ideologies do not. People should keep their religion to themselves. That way, their lives and others’ life will be great!
