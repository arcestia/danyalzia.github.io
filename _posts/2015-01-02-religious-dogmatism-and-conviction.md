This is the 21st century and the world has become a global village. People have become civilized, intellectually independent and started questioning their faith; you can’t force your beliefs on others and expect them to give respect to you! Humans have evolved intellectually and realized that organized religions and ideologies only killed more people and deterred progression. If you think that girls shouldn’t be in schools or women without veil don’t deserve respect or people deserves to die for merely holding a different belief and writing a book criticizing your faith, then you have so much in common with the Taliban, ISIS, etc.

Humans deserve respect, ideologies don’t. Keep your religion to yourself, and your life and others’ life will be great!
