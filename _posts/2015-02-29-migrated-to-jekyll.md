title: Site migrated from Tumblr to Jekyll

<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> have moved my blog / site from Tumblr to Github pages which is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I took this decision because of the following reasons:

* Slow load time speed of Tumblr; it takes more than 6 seconds to completely load the dynamic page
* Tumblr doesn't support pretty permalinks (i.e., example.com/2015/02/permalink) which is very outdated

Blog posts that were hosted on Tumblr are successfully imported here.
