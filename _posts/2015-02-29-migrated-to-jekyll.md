I have moved my blog / site from Tumblr to Github pages which is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I took this decision because of the slow load time speed of Tumblr, and the fact that Tumblr doesn't support pretty permalinks. Blog posts that were hosted on Tumblr are successfully imported here.
