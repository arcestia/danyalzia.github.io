title: Site migrated from Tumblr to Jekyll

<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> have moved my blog / site from Tumblr to Github pages which is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is platform for transforming your plain text into static websites and blogs; that is, you can write your blog posts offline in a Markdown, and the Jekyll will convert it into the equivalent HTML code, which you can upload on your webserver. 

It is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator". This platform can be used as an alternative to modern CMS, such as, WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger, etc. I took this decision because of the following reasons:

* Slow load time speed of Tumblr; it takes more than 6 seconds to completely load the dynamic page
* Tumblr doesn't support pretty permalinks (i.e., example.com/2015/02/permalink) which is very outdated

Blog posts that were hosted on Tumblr are now successfully imported here.
