<span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n the process to promote this blog, I created my account on [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/danyalzia), which is a visual discovery tool. Through it, you can create different boards to pin (post) different images. It is a great way to keep yourself reminded of the message in the images, such as, New Year resolutions, motivational quotes, etc. The best thing about Pinterest is that it's more focused on interests than people or users, which means that it's a lot easier for users to find the content of their interest than other social media networks. This enables the bloggers to share their blog posts for the potential readers, and to grow their audience.

I will be using it for sharing my blog posts and pinning the motivational images (so that I can keep working on my projects with determination). I am looking forward to meet individuals of the same interest on Pinterest.
