Today I created my account on [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/danyalzia), which is a visual discovery tool. Through it, you can create different boards to pin (post) different images. It is a great way to keep yourself reminded of the message in the images, such as, New Year resolutions, motivational quotes, etc. I am looking forward to meet individuals of the same interest on Pinterest.
