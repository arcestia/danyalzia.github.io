**(Note: This is my personal review on the story and it may contain spoilers)**

### Background

I don't usually read novels from indie authors, but as I am learning creative writing and hoping to bundle my feelings into a novel one day, I felt compelled to support indie authors. This is probably my first indie reads, especially in the genre of Young Adult (YA), which I enjoyed greatly due to its unique writing style and interesting theme, thus I am reviewing this novel happily.

### Author

[Monica Shaughnessy](http://www.monicashaughnessy.com/) is an indie author who is trying to get recognition of her creative skills through her novels. She also runs her [blog](https://monicashaughnessy.wordpress.com/) where she regularly posts her opinions on books and writing. She used to write children's novels, but she has recently started writing adult novels. Although, she holds a degree in marketing, she uses her creativity at home in writing -- and nurturing her kids.

### Plot

The description of the book says, ***"Romeo & Juliet get a fresh, sexy makeover."*** If you have read the old classic [Romeo and Juliet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet) tragedy, then you would suddenly think about the family conflict, its effect on the never-ending relationship and how the love reconciled the feuding families.

The story starts with a 16 years old girl Cassey Vogler, who calls herself *uber-nerd*, who apparently is the daughter of an esteemed astronomer: Dr. Theodore Vogler. She lives with her father on top of the mountains of Fort Nesbitt, TX. Like her father, she has extreme intelligence and was raised to use logic and reasoning while making decisions. Born with the interest in astronomy, she appeared introverted (although outgoing) and always willing to learn and experience new things. She had high standards of boys she wants to date with, preferably boys who have similar interest as hers.

She thought to spend her whole life dateless, until Jake Gunderson, a geek around her age, moves to her town. Jake Gunderson befriends her because he wants to learn more about astronomy. He has been raised in an extremely strict religious cult and always taught to put faith before reason. He is soon going to become a cult leader like his father. Logic and faith are now becoming a caustic combination for these two star-crossed lovers. Cassy takes the responsibility to save the love despite people advising against it.

### Writing Style

I find the writing style in the novel a bit unique; the sentences are broken in many places, specifically when Cassey is telling about her thoughts and surroundings, giving the sense of urge to read more and more. The author writes naturally without any concern of structured sentences -- and that's the beauty of creative writing, which the author greatly portrayed in her writing style.

Unlike other YA novels I have read, the element of curiosity seemed more prominent in the story rather than the intimation; you just keep turning pages to learn more about the story rather to read the intimate relationship between the lovers. There were humor in many places, which lightens the dark theme of the novel, so you wouldn't get depressed by the end. Overall, the writing style seemed different, which makes me want to read more novels by the author.

### Ratings

If you have read the classic Romeo and Juliet, then I would highly recommend you to read this makeover by Monica Shaughnessy, especially if you are a nerd and have an interest in the dark theme combined with YA fantasies. The readers should be matured enough, as there is some offensive language and reference. People of ages 15+ would be fine. I would rate this novel **4.5** on the scale of **5**.
