<span class="firstcharacter">E</span>very person has some form of intuition -- the natural ability or power that makes it possible to know something without any proof or evidence. It's that *gut feeling* you get when you have to take some decision quickly. Some people have learned to rely on their intuition, because they've realized that their decisions based on those feelings turns out to be very accurate over time.

Intuition isn't really a psychic ability, but the knowledge gained from the past experience by connecting different pieces and symbols to form the "big picture". It adds the meanings and interpretation to things in the metaphysical world extracted from the physical world which are hidden from the most people. The user regularly tunes his intuition and can see things past from the surface more clearly.

As an [INFJ](http://personalityjunkie.com/the-infj/), I have [Introverted Intuition (Ni)](http://personalitygrowth.com/introverted-intuition/) as my dominant function in my functional stack, which means I use this functions 80% of the time. It is the most sub-conscious function of all the Jungian cognitive functions, and dominant Ni users find it extremely hard to explain to other less intuitive people in human terms.

In order for a layman to understand Ni, I decided to talk about its manifestation in my childhood, and how it lowered my [self-esteem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem) greatly. I'll also talk about its relation to depression/anxiety due to its dominating role in my life. Although both INFJ and INTJ share Ni as their dominant function, my manifestations might apply more for an INFJ than INTJ. Reading about it won't only help you understand your Ni (if you are an Ni-dom), but it will also help you in understanding another INFJ that you may have encountered.

## Manifestations

### 1) Feeling like an alien and a completely different person

Back to school, I was bullied a lot because I wasn't an *active* type like most of the people. I loved to contemplate too much. I asked *Whys* a lot, which made people around me quite mad at me, and they distanced themselves from me, thus I felt a deep loneliness and the sense of alienation.

I was too sensitive to explain myself fluently. My insight on things were extremely hard to explain to others despite knowing myself how true they are. I was too detached from people and always been a lot more serious than the other people. I've always been an ["old soul" trapped in a young body](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/27/old-soul-struggles_n_7444210.html).

### 2) Searching for the absolute truth behind the beliefs

I've always been the skeptic of the prevalent religious beliefs that comes from organized religions and superstitions. Born in a Muslim family with an inclination to Sunni Islam, my strong intuition leaned me towards agnosticism since the early childhood.

The notion of God never made sense to me. Enjoying the traditions like most people do has always been a total non-sequitur for me. Bumping from one religion to another, I could easily see the contradictions within a particular religion. I studied sects within Islam very extensively, and how they are interrelated. When I didn't find enough satisfaction, I took the spiritual road and read things like Eckhart Tolle's work, Buddhism, Zen, etc. I used to take an idea within a single religion or philosophical school and obsessively read about it in depth to seek the closure, and when that happens, I moved on to another topic of interest.

### 3) Finding meanings behind the things

If something doesn't have a meaning behind it, then I never find enough motivation to do it. I seek meanings in everything, EVERYTHING! Even while eating/drinking, I must know that there is a cause behind it and I am not wasting my time simply doing useless stuff (eating/drinking). I've had periods in my life without eating food, because, well... I am obsessed with something.

### 4) Extreme fear and worry of the future

I had a fear every morning when I wake up; the fear to say loudly my name in school, the fear to act according to the social norms, the fear of having bullied. I really lived mostly in the future all my childhood without considering the physical present world at all. Now's the time where I am becoming more a "doer" than a dreamer.

### 5) Seeking my identity

People never really got me. I felt lonely even around people. Even I sometimes amaze myself due to my complex personality. I got so much interest in understanding the psychology behind different people to understand what makes them tick. That way, I can seek my identity as well. This part is the most prevalent in my current life. I need to define myself! This identity seeking seems more related to the Enneagram 4.

## Conclusion

Phew! I just explained my life in a nutshell, as a dominant Ni user. There were lots of experience I had in my childhood that could easily be related to my introverted intuition, but I mentioned only those things which could be shared outside my private world -- the rest can be assumed through your intuition.
