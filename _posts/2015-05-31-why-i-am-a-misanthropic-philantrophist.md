<span class="firstcharacter">M</span>ost people experience some sort of hatred towards other people at some stage of their life, particularly when they are depressed because of some people. Perhaps they feel hurt when others don't understand them, or they may consider themselves very "unique" and "special", thus creating more gap in understanding, or there may be a lack of communication which distorted them from reality.

The misanthropic shouldn't be confused with the bully or narcissistic who have hatred towards people for the sake of feeling themselves in control. It's not merely a dislike of humankind. It's rather a cynical view towards other human beings and a sense of distrust. George Carline said, "Inside every cynical person, there is a disappointed idealist.". Conversely, philantrophist likes to spend their life helping people. They see good in people, and they don't miss the opportunity to release that goodness in the people.

Misanthropy and Philantrophy are two polar extremes. When I meet a person for the first time, my mind clicks within few seconds and it judges the other person quickly and accurately. Over time, I've decided to rely more on my [intuition](http://danyalzia.com/2015/05/28/how-introverted-intuition-manifest-in-myself/) rather than thorough reasoning for judging people, because analysing those feelings too much (because they don't seem to make sense) only make the thing worse in a long term and makes me indecisive.

Almost all people have some degree of Misanthropy and Philantrophy in them, however, there is a small group in the world who are inclined to both extremes at the same time giving the right circumstances. When these opposite poles are in conflict, the following traits start manifesting in the personality:

### Indecisiveness about people

It is certainly true that I can easily see fake people. My intuition helps me understand the motives of others, even before they understand them. However, it's more about seeing both good and bad in a person, so I often end up trusting people and give them the benefit of the doubt despite knowing (without reasoning) their motives. This results in great disappointment and frustration when the person ends up being a manipulative, which makes me self-pity and self-hatred.

### Lacking drive to execute a plan of revenge

I regularly plan to take revenge from the aimless people who have hurt me and other insensitive jerks, but my consciousness stops me from executing the plan. The plan ends up conflated with my ideal world through taking the "higher road". If I'd be given a gun to kill people, then I'll come near its use for the those people, but most likely won't actually use it. These conflicting feelings frustrate me a lot.

### Evil intrusive thoughts followed by rainbows and ideal dreams

I often found myself slipping into misanthropic patterns of thought. "I want to kill this person so badly!", "Ah! This person deserves shit. He is so evil!"... "Wait. What am I supposed to do right now?", "This doesn't make sense.". These intrusive thoughts are accompanied by paranoia making life miserable.

### Confusing Panaroma

The people either see me as a cold or aloof person who hates people, or they see me as a warm and friendly person who help people, motivate them, and cracks jokes sometimes. It's extremely hard for others to judge me easily. Most people end up judging too early.

### Orientation to Narcissism

I am not a narcissist by any [reasonable definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder), however, I do have few narcissistic orientations. I think that I am truly capable of altruistic decisions in a terrible and evil world, it implies that humanity is capable of it as well, which makes me consider myself significant superior to others.

## Conclusion

My desire to help humanity is motivated by the fact that human beings are more capable than they think. The society makes general assumptions about people, and impose the social stereotypes on individuals. The influential power of love and compassion has the capability to soften the tyrant's soul and motivates them to help fellow human beings, thus creating a cycle of love.

If you have mixed feelings about people or if there are some people in your life to whom you want to take revenge, and at the same time you live your life for other people who are helpless and struggling, then you may be a misanthropic philantrophist.
