**The book remained New York Times Bestsellers for 36+ weeks.**

**(Note: This is my personal review on the story and it may contain spoilers)**

### Background

A month ago, I ordered “If I Stay” from [Liberty Books](http://libertybooks.com/) (they ship books from Amazon to Pakistan) after reading [reviews](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014241543X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=014241543X&linkCode=as2&tag=danzia-20&linkId=46VA4BTX4XLOPEWQ) on Amazon that the story had a good effect on the readers in the way how they see life, family, friends and love. I was seduced by the fact that it remained New York Best Sellers for [36+ weeks](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/young-adult/list.html), and in the mid 2014, a movie of the same name was [released](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NT96382/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00NT96382&linkCode=as2&tag=danzia-20&linkId=3URFAC7AACNGQNYL) that is based on the novel. Even though, I don't read Young Adult (YA) novels and prefer reading non-fiction over fiction, I nevertheless wanted to read some fiction to enhance my creative writing skills. I have been told that Gayle Forman is quite popular for young adult novels. So, I was very excited for the book to get delivered. It gets delivered after two days of the order. I opened the parcel as soon as I could and started reading the paperback book.

### Plot

The book starts off with a lighthearted chapter that showcases the close relationship Mia (a protagonist girl from whose point of view the story is being told) shares with her Mom, Dad and her youngest and the only brother: Teddy. I instantly realized that the family is lovely, fun and outgoing, although Mia seemed to be introverted, quiet and shy. The tone was happy. However, by page eleven, the tone of the book shifts, and everything has changed.

Mia is left staring at her broken body, while her family lie sprawled around her. She finds herself in oblivion, an oblivion where she can see, hear and touch, but can’t feel anything. From here she must make the difficult decision of staying on Earth and living, or dying and hopefully seeing her family again in the eternal world. This has to be one of the most difficult decisions anyone could ever be faced with, and I applaud Gayle Forman for writing about it so eloquently and vividly.

### Writing Style

The most prominent thing in the storytelling was that the past was intertwined with the present. This way of presenting the story through the eyes of Mia allowed us to get a glimpse into Mia’s life before the accident, and to really get to know her. Mia is a strong and appealing character, and one which I think a lot of people will identify with. I also have to mention Adam, Mia’s boyfriend. He’s caring, thoughtful and the kind of person that we should all get to meet at some point or another. He may be favourite part of the whole book for many readers.

If I Stay is indeed very moving, touching and beautifully written. It’s so gripping that you compel to read all two hundred and seven pages in one go (I finished reading the novel in two days), and is sure to be one of the year’s most talked about releases. I’d say that Gayle Forman is an eloquent writer when it comes to storytelling from first-person.

### Ratings

It was a great read. From reading the reviews, I thought that the theme is too sad, and it would have a depressing effect on my health. When I passed few pages, I found the theme quite happy and light, unlike what I read in reviews, though the theme shifts suddenly between the light of happiness and sadness. In the end, I wasn’t really sad or depressed, instead, I had a feeling of happiness and satisfacation, although it made me craved for more as I found the ending a bit dissapointing. Overall, the story made me realized the importance of ***life***, ***love*** and ***family***.

I believe it is one of those books which can inspire people to write their own story and tell it through their viewpoint. I myself wrote a small story of me being dumped by someone. My favorite line in the book is: ***"Sometimes you make choices in life, and sometimes choices make you".*** On the scale of **5**, I would give it **4.5**.
