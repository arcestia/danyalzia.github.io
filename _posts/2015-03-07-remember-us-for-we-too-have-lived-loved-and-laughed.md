<span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hile I was watching the movie [Shutter Island](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/) directed by [Martin Scorsese](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000217/), I saw this thought provoking quote engraved in a grave outside of the cemetery of the hospital. Apparently, this quote was written by a high school student, Adrienne Faessler of Medfield, Massachusetts, who won a contest for coming up with an inscription for a plaque. Shutter Island is based on [Medfield, Massachusetts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medfield,_Massachusetts) where the plaque is outside of the cemetery of the hospital.

These words caught my eye and remained in my mind for a long time. I get touched by this quote and it forced me to think about it and how it applies to my life because it was engraved on one of the graves of people who had mental illness and were sent to the mental hospital, and that's where they ***lived***, ***loved*** and ***laughed***.

It forces us to reconsider the lives of many people around us who we regard as ***mad***, ***insane***, ***disabled*** or ***different*** and to recognize the basic human characteristics they possess, such as, childish laughter, the feeling of getting touched and loved, feeling of living in a moment, etc. These people include the older ones, including parents of many around us, who were sent to institutions by their children as they were called ***insane*** without recognizing their actual needs, and so they have lost interest in their lives, and those people who were murdered mercilessly without the world knowing about it.

It's sad how easily we slip into this kind of ***illness*** by not recognizing the needs of people around us.
