<span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n my freelance writing career, I find it hard to finish the work if I don't have enough stress of deadlines. This stress is actually an [eustress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress) for me, because it motivates me enough to complete the unfinished projects. I do many projects at once, and sometimes it's hard to keep focused on a single project regardless of my decisive personality. I needs to have the ability to effectively meet a deadline.

Although, I wouldn't say that other should love deadlines too, and that they should only work effectively under deadlines, because I prefer diversity and tend to find good in the weakness of others, I do think that deadlines are very important in a successful project management.

Many people would argue that giving hard [deadlines kill the creativity](http://fortune.com/2013/10/17/how-companies-kill-creativity/) in highly potential people who, despite working under deadlines, would prefer to work when there is no external pressure of time. I would argue that it is certainly true, but deadlines should nevertheless be the part of a long-term successful project, as without it, many people may find difficulty in finishing the project.

In this blog post, I will highlight the points in favor of deadlines and why it should be part of contracts of employers when hiring employees.

### 1) It gives motivation

As mentioned earlier, deadlines provide motivation to achieve something, which is finishing the project in case of work. I only work efficiently if I have some motivation. If there is no motivation, then I can greatly lack desire. If I do this project at the right time, then I would have more time for other projects.

### 2) Recipe to kill Procrastination

Many people have a tendency to procrastinate while working on a project. This is cumbersome for them, as they find themselves in failure when they can't do work as others expected of them. This leads to self-abandonment and the sense of guilt.

I do procrastination not because I am not dedicated to complete a job within a deadline, but because I am a perfectionist and only work when I feel the moment is the right time.

### 3) Sense of responsibilty

Deadlines make you responsible that others are relying on your work. Getting your work done on time affects other people.  If you are late for your deadline, it could have a domino effect and make everyone else late as well.  In the end everyone ends up looking unprofessional and disorganised.

## Conclusion

Deadlines are arguably the catalyst in making your project successful, as many are stimulated by deadlines, as long as it doesn't end up killing the creativity in people.
